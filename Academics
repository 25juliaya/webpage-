    <p class="writing"> I used CSS to create many things for coding. I made a web page a video game and data analysis, and I also learned how CSS has impacted artificial intelligence. I learned the basic coding skills through snap and MIT. Code.hs then helped me learn HTML web design and python. CSS and AI are both now a huge part of my life everyn day.
